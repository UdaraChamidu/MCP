- here we are using mcp-use library.
(github: https://github.com/mcptutorial/mcp-use)

- using uv is likely better. but i am using normal pip. 

- playwright ... 

- node required

- go to google and search for different mcp servers and add to .json file. it is the cofiguration...

- consider that we need npx (check inside above told configuration code parts...)

- mcp servers are in .json file...
